In a large dataset, quickly finding a target data typically involves using efficient data structures and algorithms. Here are some common strategies and methods:

1. **Binary Search:**
   - For ordered datasets, binary search is an efficient method. It has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the dataset. This method requires the dataset to be sorted.

2. **Hash Table (Hashing):**
   - Using a hash function to map data to array indices can achieve constant-time average case lookup. The performance of hash tables depends significantly on the quality of the hash function and collision resolution methods.

3. **Tree Structures:**
   - Tree structures like Binary Search Trees (BST), Balanced Binary Search Trees (AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree), provide fast search performance with an average time complexity of O(log n).

4. **Skip List:**
   - A skip list is a data structure that accelerates searches by adding multiple layers of indexing. In some cases, skip lists can outperform balanced binary search trees.

5. **Linear Search Optimization:**
   - If the dataset is unsorted, linear search with optimizations such as secondary indices or block search can be employed to enhance efficiency.

6. **Divide and Conquer:**
   - By dividing the dataset into smaller subproblems, the divide and conquer approach can speed up searches. Classic examples include merge sort and quicksort.

7. **Bitmap Index:**
   - For specific data types like boolean data, bitmap indexes can be used to accelerate searches.

8. **Parallel Algorithms:**
   - In multi-core or distributed systems, parallel algorithms can be used to speed up the search process by dividing the dataset into multiple parts and searching concurrently.

9. **Approximation Algorithms:**
   - If exact matching is not crucial, approximation algorithms can be considered, sacrificing some accuracy for faster search speeds.

Choosing the right method depends on the characteristics of the dataset, search requirements, memory constraints, and other contextual factors. In practical applications, a combination of factors may need to be considered to select the most suitable strategy.
