In Swift, `try?` and `try!` are two different ways of handling errors.

1. `try?`: It is used to convert errors to optional values when calling a function or method that can throw an error. If an error is thrown, the result of the expression will be `nil`. If no error is thrown, the result will be an optional value containing the return value of the function or method. Using `try?` makes the code more concise without the need to explicitly handle the error.

   For example:
   ```swift
   if let result = try? someThrowingFunction() {
       // Execute logic when there is no error
   } else {
       // Execute logic when there is an error
   }
   ```

2. `try!`: It is used to call a function or method that can throw an error but explicitly states that the call will not result in an error, and if an error does occur, it will cause a crash. Therefore, using `try!` must be done with a high degree of certainty that the call will not result in an error.

   For example:
   ```swift
   let result = try! someNonThrowingFunction()
   // Error handling is not required here; if an error occurs, it will cause a crash
   ```

The choice between `try?` and `try!` depends on your confidence in the error handling of the function or method. If you are certain that the call will not throw an error, you can use `try!`, but if you are uncertain, using `try?` can handle errors more safely.
