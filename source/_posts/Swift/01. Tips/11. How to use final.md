In Swift, the keyword `final` is used to mark classes, properties, or methods, preventing them from being inherited or overridden. Using `final` ensures that specific classes, properties, or methods cannot be inherited or overridden by other classes, thus enhancing the safety and stability of the code. Here are some common use cases:

1. Class: Declaring a class as `final` prevents other classes from inheriting it. This is useful when you intentionally design a class that should not be inherited or when you want to ensure that specific behaviors of a class will not be altered.

   ```swift
   final class MyClass {
       // Class definition
   }
   ```

2. Method: Declaring a method within a class as `final` prevents subclasses from overriding it. This is useful when you want to ensure that the behavior of a method remains unchanged or unaltered.

   ```swift
   class BaseClass {
       final func myMethod() {
           // Method implementation
       }
   }
   ```

3. Property: Declaring a property within a class as `final` prevents subclasses from overriding it. This is useful when you want to maintain the immutability of a property's value.

   ```swift
   class BaseClass {
       final var myProperty: Int = 5
   }
   ```

Using the `final` keyword ensures that your code is more secure and predictable, preventing unexpected inheritance or overriding behavior.
